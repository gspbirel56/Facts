# Facts
# Authors: Justin Leone, Dan Farquhar, Chris Morris

This app shows fun facts on a Chevy vehicle. It was conceived and created during HackPSU 2017, and it was definitely
a learning experience for all of us!

It is an app that shows fun facts. When you press different controls in the car, it will choose frmo a specific category of facts.
It was built using the GM SDK and we tested it using the SDK-included emulator as well as a 2017 Chevy Volt.

Some controls worked in the Volt that could not be emulated due to limited emulator controls.

This was a learning experience because all 3 of our group members did not have any experience with Javascript or much HTML,
let alone the GM SDK. We overcame many obstacles and learned not only about how nice the languages were, but also about the
security features implemented by GM to ensure that no code monkeys like us could hack into cars while people are driving them.

We took a lot away from this experience and would like to personally thank GM, their engineers, and Penn State University for
giving us this great opportunity to work with their technology as if we were employees of GM. It was a wonderful experience and we
look forward to future Hackathons and the future of the automotive industry. Long live computer science!
